#QUESTIONS OF THE CENTURY

### A collective effort to solve the pressing Unanswered Questions of our Time.

This is a wiki to gather collective intelligence and solve, once and for all, all the important Questions that have nagged humanity since it stood in two legs.

To be able to contribute (create a Question, or modify an answer) users needs to register first.

Nevertheless, unauthenticated users can still view all Q&As.

The  detailed view of a Question/Answer not only provides the answer so sought, but also list all the users who helped throw light on it.

These contributors are shown as links that direct to a page where we can see the list of Questions they contributed to.

This functionality is considered private and unauthenticated users cannot view access it.
